Backlog:

    * As a developer, I have instructions on how to build the package.
    * As a developer, I can view documentation from RPi
    * Mark relay tests as slow.
    * Get color sensor working on RPi.
    * Write test with relays controlling lights and monitored by color sensor.
    * Implement a USB print tree command for package.
    * Epic: Get package available on PyPi
    * Next Epic: Get repository good enough to be publically visible.
