USB Device Tree
===============

This page shows the USB devices and the PCI devices and buses that are used to
connect them to the computer.  Please note that single physical USB devices may
consist of multiple USB components and these components will present themselves
as a number of logical USB devices.

To make this tree more comprehensible, you may want to define aliases
for devices, and implement a color coding for these devices.

To define an alias, click on a button associated with the node.
