.. astutus_dyn_bookmark:: Astutus Dynamic Pages - /astutus/app

.. astutus_dyn_link:: "/astutus/app/index.html"

.. astutus_dyn_destination:: dyn_index.html

Astutus uses a custom extension to Sphinx to provide dynamic HTML pages.
This approach makes it easy to add instructions and guidance functional
pages.  It makes it easy to get a **good-enough** look-and-feel, without
a lot of investment in custom styling.  It provides a high degree of
integration between end user functionality, system documentation, and
development planning and execution.
