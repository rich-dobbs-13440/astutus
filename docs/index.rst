   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Introduction
============

**Astutus** is a Python3 package.  It is intended to:

   * Serve as a useful code base from which I can search and reuse code as needed.
   * Serve as a means to capture ideas and concepts that I've learned and want to efficiently reuse.
   * Act as portfolio to demonstrate the range and depth of my development and work skills.
   * Provide useful capabilities that others can use to be more effective.  I hope these
     capabilities include software functions, ways of getting things done, and
     priortizing work.  The capabilities are directed at test-driven-development, automation,
     and continuous integration / continuous deployment in a very-small, high-performance
     team setting.

.. warning::

   This work is targeted at Linux-like computers.  At this time, it has only been
   used with Linux Mint and Raspberry Pi OS.  The actual functionality depends
   on operating system specific utilities that are not available in Windows-based
   computers.
