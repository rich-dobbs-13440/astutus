Introduction
------------

**Astutus** is a Python3 package.  It is intended to:

   * Serve as a useful code base from which I can search and reuse code as needed.
   * Serve as a means to capture ideas and concepts that I've learned and want to efficiently reuse.
   * Act as portfolio to demonstrate the range and depth of my development and work skills.
   * Provide useful capabilities that others can use to be more effective.  I hope these
     capabilities include software functions, ways of getting things done, and
     priortizing work.  The capabilities are directed at test-driven-development, automation,
     and continuous integration / continuous deployment in a very-small, high-performance
     team setting.
