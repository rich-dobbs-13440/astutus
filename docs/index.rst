   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Astutus
==================

Astutus is a repository to demonstrate the range and depth of my
python development skills.  It also serves as a useful codebase
from which I can search and reuse code as needed. Finally, it
serves as repository of things that I've learned and want to be
able to efficiently reuse.

Git repository
--------------

The code can be found at https://github.com/rich-dobbs-13440/astutus.

Why is it called **Astutus**?
-----------------------------

The same name should be used for a repository as for the python package.
In both cases, the name should be short, memorable, and easily searchable.

For example, **flask** is
a good name, because when searching on the internet for software,
it is easy to make a good search, just by searching for
**python flask**.  In contrast, **robot** is a poor name for a
testing framework, since there are a lot of things related to
robot and robots that might use python.

So the first thing to do in selecting a package name is to to
do a search.  In this case, I started with animals in Colorado.
This lead to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-tailed_cat.
Which has a species name of Bassariscus astutus.  Hmmm.  Maybe
astutus would be a good package name.  So search for **astutus**.
Essentially no hits for software related items.

As a bonus:  Here is the meaning in Latin:  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/astutus

Meaning:  shrewd, sagacious, expert, astute.

**Sounds wonderful.**
