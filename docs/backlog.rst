Backlog:

  * Spike: Try to use Sphinx to generate a styled base for a Jinja2 template.
  * Task: Display USB tree in browser, to enable a better user interface for
    configuring aliases.  Command line + editing files to complicated and confusing!
  * Story: As a user, I can configure my own aliases for physical USB devices
    devices in the USB tree.
  * Story: As a developer, I can view documentation from RPi
  * Task: Mark relay tests as slow.
  * Task: Single source version number between code, package, and documentation.
  * Task: Get color sensor working on RPi.
  * Task: Write test with relays controlling lights and monitored by color sensor.
  * Story: Implement a USB print tree command for package.

  * Next Epic: Get repository good enough to be publically visible.
