Developer Notes
===============

Plan for Feburary, 2021:

  * Start using GitHub Automation

  * Start updating PyPi with each merge to "Master"

  * Automate versioning for developer versus production builds

  * Work on automated testing for gatekeeping prior to PyPi publication.

  * Backfill automated testing for USB functionality, that can be run inside GitHub

  * Checkout Python package on more systems and gracefully degrade.

  * Publish documentation on Read-the-Docs.
