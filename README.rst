Astutus Readme
==============

Astutus is a portofolio to demonstrate the range and depth of my
python development skills.  It also serves as a useful codebase
from which I can search and reuse code as needed. Next, it
serves as repository of things that I've learned and want to be
able to efficiently reuse.

Finally, over the next few months it will develop into
a set of capabilities that you might find useful.

Installing
----------

Install and update using `pip`_:

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U astutus --pre

Please note the use of **--pre** option.  With the current build
automation, the packages published to PyPI are all marked as alpha.


Technologies
------------

Here are some of the technologies I've used in the past and will
be incorporating into this code base.

Not all of these are yet incorporated into this code base.
This is a work-in-progress.  As time passes more of these
capabilities will be published.
