Astutus
=======

Astutus is a portofolio to demonstrate the range and depth of my
python development skills.  It also serves as a useful codebase
from which I can search and reuse code as needed. Next, it
serves as repository of things that I've learned and want to be
able to efficiently reuse.

Finally, over the next few months it will develop into
a set of capabilities that you might find useful.

Installing
----------

Install and update using `pip`_:

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U astutus


Technologies
------------

Here are the technologies some of the technologies I've used in past:

- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Jinja2
- HTML5
- CSS
- SQL
- Sphinx
- Restructured Text
- Integrated Documentation
- Setuptools
- Pytest
- REST API's
- Continuous Improvement
- Automation
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Docker
- Raspbery Pi
- Semantic Versioning
- Agile Planning
- Bias for Action

Not all of these are yet incorporated into this code base.
This is a work-in-progress.  As time passes more of these
capabilities will be published.
