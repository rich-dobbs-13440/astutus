            <div class="astutus-toggle">
            <p>To the developer:  Your <strong>backlog</strong> should consist of epics, stories, tasks, and spikes. For planning purposes,
            your backlog shouldn’t be too large and it shouldn’t be too small.  You’ll need to
            at least one epic on it, and I don’t understand why you’d need more than two!
            Stories tell where you’re headed, and tasks get you there. Spikes are for deciding
            what to do, and helping you know how long until you get there.</p>
            <p>At any point, it should be possible for a smart manager to look at your backlog,
            understand what you are trying to get done, what sort of things that you are
            currently working on, and whether you are about done.</p>
            <p>By looking at your backlog over time, it should be possible for a smart manager
            to understand about where you’ll be at in the future, without having to
            trust your assessment (which is probably over-optimimistic!).</p>
            <p>Chances are, you should be adding tasks after each commmit, as you discover
            new tasks, plan new work, or get to the point where you want to communicate
            details of the work required.</p>
